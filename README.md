# Description

Fake news is a type of `yellow journalism` or `propaganda` that consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media.

The false information is then often reverberated as misinformation in social media, but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well. Fake news is written and published with the intent to `mislead` in order to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership, online sharing, and Internet click revenue. 

In the latter case, it is similar to sensational online "clickbait" headlines and relies on advertising revenue generated from this activity, regardless of the veracity of the published stories. Intentionally `misleading and deceptive fake news` differs from obvious `satire` or `parody`, which is intended to amuse rather than mislead its audience.
